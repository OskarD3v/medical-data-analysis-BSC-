Hello!
I am currently enrolled as a student in medical data analysis/science. I am very new to programming, but genuinely super eager to learn.
It's awesome what help and tools we have nowadays, ranging from youtube tutorials to intricate and hands-on datacamp courses, but to be honest;
The proper way to learn is to do, and do again, then try and try some more. So far I am very satisfied with my studies, although it can get a little
overwhelming, its normal - especially if one is new to a specific field.

Background:
I finished school and wanted to study medicine, the semester after graduation I wasnt accepted - although I had very good grades, it hurt - but ultimatively? 
It was good it gave me some time to reflect what I'd like to do: here we are, combining two super complex industry fields! Medical data analysis. Nice.

Facts:
I have an obsession with languages (and no- not for coding); currently learning my sixth.
It has similarities with learning to code, its hard, sucks a tiny but, but in the end: it is worth it.
